### Explanation:

- The application asks for a path to the requested shared folder on the client file system
- The code finds the name of the USERPROFILE through OS module. And changes the directory to access the files on the desktop.
- The code creates an HTTP request
- Finds the hostname to serve the file in a particular port for secured sharing.
- Then finds the IP address of the system so that we can connect a particular device.
- The aplication opens a socket for a continuous stream of data between client and server
- Once the device connected to the same network  the IP address can access the files of the system.
